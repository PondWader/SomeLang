When the program is started, the main procedure will launch either the profiler viewer section or the interpreter to execute a program. This is based on the flags passed to the program via the command line by the user. If the "-profiler-viewer" flag is passed, the program will open the profiler viewer user interface. If not it will check that the "-run" flag has been passed followed by the entrypoint file to execute. There will also be an optional "-profile" flag that can be passed with the "-run" flag to run the profiler during the programs execution and produce a results file.

The main procedure will:
1. Read the flags passed via the command line and run the correct part of the program
If the interpreter is run:
2. Read the program file
3. Parse the content, stepping through each token
4. Execute the abstract syntax tree
If the profile viewer is started:
2. Get, validate and read profile results file from the user (out: resultsContent)
3. Parse the results content CSV in to an array of objects (in: resultsContent (string), out: results ([Result]))
3. Render profiler results chart using data (in: results ([Result]))
